The `SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key"` you have currently is a placeholder. While the application will run with it, it is **not secure** for any real-world use, even for development if you plan to share or deploy it.

The `SECRET_KEY` is used to cryptographically sign your JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which are essential for securing user sessions. If this key is weak, easily guessable, or exposed, an attacker could forge valid tokens, impersonate users, and gain unauthorized access to your application.

**You MUST change it to a strong, randomly generated key.**

Here's how you can generate a strong secret key (for example, using Python):

```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32)) # Generates a 32-byte URL-safe text string
```

Replace `"your-super-secret-key"` in `backend/app/config.py` with the output of this command.

For example, it might look something like:
`SECRET_KEY="a_very_long_and_random_string_of_characters_and_numbers"`

Please update your `SECRET_KEY` to a secure value.
