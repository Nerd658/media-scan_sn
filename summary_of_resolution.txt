I understand. Thank you for providing the corrected `vite.config.js` configuration.

It seems the missing `tailwindcss()` plugin was indeed the cause of the broken design, and the proxy configuration with `'/api'` as the key (without a `rewrite` rule) is correctly forwarding your API requests to the backend.

I'm glad to hear that everything is now working as expected!

The task of integrating the API for login and registration into your frontend is now complete.
